Hi! I mainly talk about RPGs, miniature game and terrain making. I mainly focus on techniques that I haven't seen before to make the process more efficient.

For RPGs I primarily play PBTA and Old School Roleplaying games. Iâ€™m intruiged by RPG design, layout for readability and efficiency and how we can use programming tools to improve the RPG experience.

With miniatures I enjoy miniature painting and play games like Stargrave/Frostgrave, Mordheim and Warmachine. I like experimenting with relatively fast and good looking paint schemes for skirmish warbands.

This blog is primarily inspired by the indie RPG blogosphere.

The blog name is a play on the double meaning of scheme. In regards to miniature painting it refers to paint scheme decider. For RPGs it refers to the schemes players come up with. Decyder is to give it searchability and as a reference to my online name, Decyne.
