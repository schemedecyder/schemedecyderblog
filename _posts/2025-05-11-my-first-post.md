title: "Using Painting Fads in your Workflow"

Throughout time there have been a number of different fads and trends for painting miniatures fast (speed painting). Dipping, slapchop, oil washing. Some of these fade to obscurity, while others are incorporated into normal workflows.

In my opinion, the best way to use all (most? I'm glad dipping has faded into obscurity) of these techniques is in combination with each other and normal brushwork. For example, a miniature painted with contrast paints gives a very 'constarst painted' look. However painting a miniature with normal methods, but using contrast paint on fiddly, unimportant bits like belt buckles and pouches, maybe with a brush highlight in there, results in a fast painjob on the unimportant sections, with a finish that is indistinguishable from layering with a brush for tabletop quality purposes.

Combining techniques. Purple -> white zentihal, speed paintover the top, oil wash and brush layering/chipping.

Brush layered skin and black cloth, speed painted textured fiddly bits.

 The current YouTube painting trend looks to be using makeup sponges to achieve gradients. When compared to an airbrush:
Advantages: 
- Cheaper
- Easier to avoid overspray
Disadvantages:
- Not as smooth transitions
- Hard to reach crevasses 
???:
- Leaves a speckled textured finish

So how can we combine this technique with others to reduce 

The question always comes down to, is the additional time combining these techniques worth the outcome? The advantage of something like slapchop is the small number of steps, and sometimes using multiple techniques can be slower than just painting the model with a brush.
