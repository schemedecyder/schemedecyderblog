title: "Using Painting Fads in your Workflow"

Throughout time there have been a number of different fads and trends for painting miniatures fast (speed painting). Dipping, slapchop, oil washing. Some of these fade to obscurity, while others are incorporated into normal workflows.

In my opinion, the best way to use all (most? I'm glad dipping has faded into obscurity) of these techniques is in combination with each other and normal brushwork. For example, a miniature painted with contrast paints gives a very 'constarst painted' look. However painting a miniature with normal methods, but using contrast paint on fiddly, unimportant bits like belt buckles and pouches, maybe with a brush highlight in there, results in a fast painjob on the unimportant sections, with a finish that is indistinguishable from layering with a brush for tabletop quality purposes.

Combining techniques. Purple -> white zentihal, speed paintover the top, oil wash and brush layering/chipping.

Brush layered skin and black cloth, speed painted textured fiddly bits.

 The current YouTube painting trend looks to be using makeup sponges to achieve gradients. When compared to an airbrush:
Advantages: 
- Cheaper
- Easier to avoid overspray
Disadvantages:
- Not as smooth transitions
- Hard to reach crevasses 
???:
- Leaves a speckled textured finish

So how can we maximise the benefits and reduce the downsides of this technique? My first thought is that sponging is good for models with two large surfaces of different colours. Airbrushes struggle with this because of the overspray, but sponges are a bit easier to control. With sponges it's hard to get in the recesses to get a solid base coat. However, what if we don't want a solid coat? Another speed painting technique is underpainting with interesting colours, then only painting highlights, leaving the recesses as the underpaint, reducing the amount of brushstrokes. Combining sponging over the top of this, the sponge won't apply paint to the recesses, leaving  the interesting undertone in the recesses. I tested this on a random model and you can see the results below.

The question always comes down to, is the additional time combining these techniques worth the outcome? The advantage of something like slapchop is the small number of steps, and sometimes using multiple techniques can be slower than just painting the model with a brush. we shall see...

I find it useful to define what I want the model/army to look like before I put any paint on it. both in terms of theme and quality. I want this army to look like they've just emerged from dark, subterranean tunnels to strike. For quality, I'm aiming for a striking tabletop quality with lots of contrast, maybe without being the technically best I can execute. Mainly I want to get a model where the basecoats and 'boring stuff's are done quickly. I'm happy to spend time adding details and glazing fun colours. I whipped up a test scheme on the computer and put some paint on a Tyranid. I don't always do this but have been thinking about this scheme for a while.

Test model... Vipex, what I want to do.

First I wanted to create the interesting underpainting using my airbrush. I decided on blue -> purple -> magenta shift because I already know that it looks good. I started with a black -> white zenithal, then, I started with my purple tone. I started with this because this was the main colour and I wanted to make sure I got the colour ratios right. I focused on the body and middle of the wings. I know that I wanted a full transition from magenta to blue on the wings. In addition, I also put purple on the mushrooms because I want them to be glowing. With the main colour you always want to cover more of the model than you think, because in the next steps the other colours will start to cover it up and tint it. The trick is creating a smooth gradient of the purple. I'd recommend using purple ink and adding some thinner. The magenta was focused on the head, as the main feature of the model and the tops of the wings. Blue was added to the 'boring' bits like the base and bottom of the model.

Talk about using airbrush here. It's a bit funny that I'm using it only for the start of the model and not for the whole thing. Am I wasting time by needing to set it up and clean it? Would it be better just to spraypaint purple? (maybe this bit goes at end).

The reason I think the sponging works is because this model is made up of lots of little flat panels. Tapping the sponge highlights the top of the panel while leaving the bottom. I think the panels are a bit too flat to get a good finish with contrast paint, and you'd lose a lot of the shadows if you were just airbrushing. However, I did end up using the airbrush on the wings because the sponges were too slow on the large flat surfaces.
